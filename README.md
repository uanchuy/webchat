## What is a webchat?

The Recast.AI webchat let you **deploy a bot straight to a website**. It will be embed and available through a chat box on your pages.
The webchat is one of the many channels available on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai), and end-to-end bot building platform.
This webchat is built using the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) library, along with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for state managment.

## Compatibility

This webchat is supported by all mobile and desktop browsers in their latest versions.
Internet Explorer support starts at version 9.0.

## Usage

Three different installations on the webchat module are possible.
- The default is the simplest and fatest route, and offers some customization options.
- The self-hosted webchat offers even more customization option, but you'll have to deal with the hosting and maintenance of the module.
- Use it as a React component

### Default webchat

To use the webchat, you need an account on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) and a bot.
Then, go to the **CONNECT** tab and click on **Webchat**. It will open a window that lets you adjust your webchat settings, including:
* color scheme,
* header customization,
* bot and user pictures,
* webchat logo and call to action,
* conversation duration

Once you're satisfied with the settings, click on the **SAVE** button. A script tag appears, and you just have to copy paste it in your web page to embed the webchat. The script must be placed in the `<body>` tag.

### Self-hosted webchat

If you want to customize your webchat even more, you can opt for a self-hosted installatiton. Just fork this project to get started!

#### Installation

Clone the repository you forked, and install the dependencies.

```
$> git clone YOUR_REPO_URL
$> cd webchat
$> npm install
```

#### Run in development mode

```
$> npm run start
```

#### Eslint + prettier

```
$> npm run prettier
```

#### Build for production

```
$> npm run build
```

#### Use your webchat

Once you're done, build it and host it.
To use it instead of the default one provided by Recast.AI, you need to set up the Webchat channel in the **CONNECT** tab of your bot.
You'll be using the same script as the default installation, but you have **to replace the src field by your own URL**.


```
<script
  src="YOUR_WEBCHAT_URL"
  ...
></script>
```

### React component
You can import the webchat as a React component like the following example:
``` js
import RecastWebchat from 'webchat';

export default class ReactWebchat extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <RecastWebchat
        onRef={ref => {
          this.webchat = ref;
        }}
